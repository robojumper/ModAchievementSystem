A system for mods to register and unlock achievements. Takes care of all the UI work for mods.

[b]Features[/b]

[list]
[*] [i]Optional Dependency[/i] - It's not required for your users, everything will work normally if they don't install the Achievement System
[*] [i]Lightweight API[/i] - Only one class to tell my mod what achievement to unlock. Everything else is handled by my mod.
[*] [i]In-game popups[/i] - some small popups, but nothing that hinders gameplay
[*] [i]Default Icons[/i] - Can't design icons? No worries, we prepared something.
[*] [i]Support for points, categories and completion rates[/i] - The maximum amount of gimmicks you can get. Also, hidden achievements.
