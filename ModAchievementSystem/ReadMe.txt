[h1]A framework mod to add achievement support to Mods. Other mods define and unlock achievements, this mod gives you popups and has a nice screen.[/h1]

[b]Already Supported[/b]
[list]
[*] Grimy's Mods
[*] RealityMachina's Mods
[*] A Better Advent
[*] Some More Achievements (by me)
[/list]

[b]Features[/b]
[list]
[*] [i]Optional Dependency[/i] - It's not required for your users, everything will work normally if they don't install the Achievement System
[*] [i]Lightweight API[/i] - Only one class to tell my mod what achievement to unlock. Everything else is handled by my mod.
[*] [i]In-game popups[/i] - some small popups, but nothing that hinders gameplay
[*] [i]Default Icons[/i] - Can't design icons? No worries, we prepared something.
[*] [i]Support for points, categories and completion rates[/i] - The maximum amount of gimmicks you can get. Also, hidden achievements.
[*] [i]Counting Achievements[/i] - So mod authors don't have to keep track of everything.

Huge thanks to Grimy and RealityMachina, for they were the first to implement achievements and give valuable feedback!
